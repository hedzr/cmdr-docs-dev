#### About cmdr

`cmdr` is a command-line parser, app framework, and integrated with app settings management and config source loaders optionally.

`cmdr` helps to focus your sight into the bussiness logic developments.

We have `cmdr-series` in serveral different languages, including C++, Golang, and C#, and so on. All the versions have a unify API for developers and end-users.

#### Store

[Store](https://github.com/hedzr/store) has been integrated into `cmdr` to provide configuration management abilities.

In another angle, `Store` is also providing a general purpose key-value storage in memory. So using it for Cache, Redis-like, or httprouter parser are both possible.

Store provides auto-reset a key in timeout (TTL).

Store provides the matching on `/[id]/` routes and returning the matched state.

#### progressbar

[progressbar](https://github.com/hedzr/progressbar) is a terminal progressbar library in golang.

The original intent of `progressbar` is for covering a python install like progressbar. It's done. And after several iterations it evoluates a riched-theme progressbar library which can provide more facades in console ui. It includes `Stepper` and `Spinner` now.

`progress` also provides more friendly api to support for coding the multi-routines tasks.
