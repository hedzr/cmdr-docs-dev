## Flags

### What is Flag, and Option?

Inside `cmdr.v2`, terms `Flag` and `Option` are used confusingly, and constantly. But, these two terms are different in fact.

A `Flag`, means that an object created via the interfaces like `app.Flg()`/`builder.Flg()`, which will be used for interpreting an cmdline option, and there is also a coresponding `Option` item in `Option Store` that is mapping to it.

A `Option` item, means that a key-value pair in `Option Store`. For instance, `“app.debug” => true` is a kv pair entry. The hierarchical layout of its yaml representation is,

```yaml
app:
  debug: true
```

In the most scenes, we would like use `Option` to represent a key-value pair identified by `keyPath`, whatever it is a `Flag` exactly, or not.

### Integrated with `Option Store`

We knew `Option Store` is a in-memory config manager for hierarchical key-value pairs dataset identified by `dottedPath`/`keyPath`. And, an `Option` can be associated with a `Flag`, or not. But there is always an `Option` binded to a `Flag`.

For the top level flag `--debug`, the store entry associated with it is `app.cmd.debug`, since `app.cmd` is a hard-coded prefix for command line options.

For those flags of subcmds, such as `--cacert` under subcmd `cert / create`, the entry dotted path would be `app.cmd.cert.create.cacert`.

#### `cmd.Store()` vs `cmd.Set()`

Programmatically, you can code with `app.Store()/app.Set()`.

The `cmd.Store()` returns a subset of app's whole Store, which have a root key pointed to key path `app.cmd.jump.to`. That means, `cmd.Store().MustBool("full")` can read and write the state of a command line flag `--full`.

The `cmd.Set()` returns the app's whole Store, which equals to `app.Set()`，So you need a `cmd.Set().MustBool("app.cmd.jump.to.full")` to access the state of `--full`. Another way is,

```go
set := cmd.Set().WithPrefix(cli.DottedPathToCommandOrFlag)
println(set.MustBool("full"))
assert.Equal(set, cmd.Store())
```

The similar call to `app.Store()` will get a subtree pointed to `app.cmd`, which stores the values of all of command-line flags. So `app.Store().MustBool("jump.to.full")` can query the same key above.

> For a short and concise calling statement, it's useful by using `GetXXX`/`MustXXX` on the object of `cmd.Store()`/`app.Store()`.

The prefix `app.cmd` is used for serializing the `Option Store`, such as YAML, TOML, etc.. The notable point is `app` will be stripped when you're really serializing it. So a key `app.some.path.debug` will be stored as `some.path.debug` in a YAML file:

```yaml
some:
  path:
    debug: false
```

As a sample, here is a Store's YAML file content:

```yaml
# The common prefix `app` will be stripped in serializing to a file.
logging:
  file: /var/log/app/stdout.log
server:
  port: 3000
  host: 0.0.0.0
  tls: {}
  domains: []
# The following entries are visible only in memory.
# We list them for showing the completely Store-tree
# more clearly.
cmd:
  debug: false # 对应于 `--debug`
  verbose: false # 对应于 `--verbose`
```

#### `keyPath`/`dottedPath`

`keyPath`/`dottedPath`/`dottedKeyPath` is a exclusive term specially for `Option Store`, which provides an anchor to any entries in the `Store` by the form `prefix.subcmds...flag`.

For an intance, a dottedPath `app.cmd.cert.create.cacert` has `app.cmd` as a special prefix for command-line flags, and `cert.create` is subcommands `cert` and its child `create`, and `cacert` is the long title of a flag, which belongs to subcmds `cert.create`.

The flag `cacert` can be specified by `--cacert` from command-line.

### Long Flag, Short and Alias

The term `Long Flag` is required for a command-line flag. It is the unique identifier in `cmdr` system.

A `Long Flag` has prefix `--` in the command-line. For example, `--cacert` is a flag of subcmds `cert.create`:

```bash
$ app cert create --cacert "./ca.cer"
```

The `Short Flag` can be attached to a command-line flag. It uses prefix `-` in the command-line. It is a shortcut to a flag.

Under `cmdr.v2` system, multiple short flags can be attached with one flag by using call like `b.Flg(longTitle, shortTitle...).ExtraShorts(...)`.

Short flag is constantly a single char in POSIX standard. So we can use `-v` as the shortcut to `--verbose` flag.

But in `cmdr` system (both v1 and v2), a short flag can be a string with any length. As a sample, `-ap` has short title `ap`, shortcut to `--extra-files`, this is legal too.

Golang `flags` uses a wired form different than POSIX standard, which has no short or long flag, all flags have the single hyphen char as its leading prefix. That is why in a golang app `-port` will be used for setting the listening port number rather than `--port`.

> `cmdr` is a POSIX-compliant command-line argument parser. So we recommend using `-p` and `--port` to specify port number. But you can still make a golang flag like app by specifying a short flag with title name `port`, this is legal option.

By using the builder interface, `Flg(longTitle, shortTitle, ...)` allows more alias titles associated with a flag. The alias titles are equavalent to long flag, with the leading double hyphen chars `--`.

As a sample, `b.Flg("version", "V", "ver")` defines a version flag with both long, short and alias titles. So the following command-line inputs are avaliable:

```bash
$ app --version
$ app -V
$ app --ver
```

Totally you can always organize your command and flag system in a freestanding form. Keep it concise. Too much command depthes and too much more flags are not kindly enough to end-user.

### Compat short flags

Multiple short flags can be compated into one leading hyphen char `-`, this is POSIX-compliant. The compat form is equavalent to the split form:

```bash
-azro === -a -z -r -o === -a -zr -o
```

### Default Value

You can specify the default value to a flag, with different types.

`b.Flg("count", "c").Default(3)` defined its default value is `int(3)`.

The primitive value, including integer, float, complex, boolean, or string, time, duration, slice can be specified as the default value of a flag.

So `b.Flg("interval", "i").Default(3*time.Second)` defined a time duration value `3s`. End user can input the new value with Golang literal convension, for a example:：

```bash
$ app -i 8m
```

It specifys a duration value with 8 minutes, which overrides the default value when you defined it.

### Duplicated inputs

In general, duplicated inputs of a flag causes the old value to be overlapped by the new one.

So `app -c 3 -c 4 -c 5` means the final value of `-c` is 5.

The exception is slice value. The duplicated inputs of a flag with default slice value causes the new value to apppend to the old. And, the delimiter char `,` is used for splitting the items in one input string.

This means, as for a flag `b.Flg("add", "a").Default([]string{"a", "b"})`, the input `app -a z,y -a x -a u,v,w` will get the final value `[]string{"z","y","x","u","v","w"}`.

### Input in command-line

#### Stripping quotes

cmdr support stripping the quote chars for a flag:

- `--host=localhost`
- `--hostlocalhost`
- `--host localhost`
- `"--hostlocalhost"`
- `'--hostlocalhost'`
- `--host"localhost"`
- `--host'localhost'`
- `--host "localhost"`

and so on.

These quote chars will be removed by shell automatically. If not, `cmdr` will do it.

#### Slice value

While a flag is associated with a default slice value, such as `[]string`, `cmdr` will merge the duplicated inputs as once slice. That means, `-f a -f b -f c` will be translated to the final value `[]string{"a", "b", "c"}`. Since the comma `,` character will be treated as delimiter for splitting a string into slice, so `-f a,b -f c` will get the same final value.

#### Hit info

`cmdr` maintains a hit info record, including the flag title string, short or long, untranslated raw value, and hit times. Sometimes you could change the bizlogic with these records.

#### Default behavior of `--verbose`

The builtin flag `--verbose` has these behaviors:

1. nothing input,

   The hidden flags/commands wouldn't be shown on help screen

2. once (`-v`),

   The hidden flags/commands could be shown

3. triple times (`-v -v -v` or `-vvv`)

   The vendor-hidden flags/commands will be shown onto help screen

You can redefined the hit times or other hit info. As a case, you could treat the hit times of `--verbose` as a level in 0..9, and uses the level for how many tip messages can be visible in logging.

> For the builtin flags, such as `verbose`, `quiet`, `debug`, the final state, hit-times (level) are organized into [`Env`](https://github.com/hedzr/is/blob/master/detects.go#L250) manager inside package [`hedzr/is`](https://github.com/hedzr/is),

> - `is.QuietModeEnabled()`, `is.GetQuietLevel()`
> - `is.NoColorModeEnabled()`, `is.GetNoColorLevel()`
> - `is.DebugMode()`, `is.GetDebugLevel()`
> - `is.TraceMode()`, `is.GetTraceLevel()`

### Styles of short flag

Short flags can have multiple characters rather than single one

We supports a phrase as a short flag title.

In another words, you can blur out the differences between short and long flag, so that the golang flag style and GNU getopt style could live at a same app together.

> Golang flag style: the flags are always leading by single hyphen character: `-host abc -port 9999`
>
> GNU getopt style: both the leading hyphen `-` and double hyphen `--` are avaliable for short and long flag. A short flag has single character or number as its title, mostly in POSIX. The sample: `-d -t --retry 3`。
>
> cmdr style: beyond getopt style, remote the limit about single char title for the short flag. So `-host abc` and `-host abc --retry 3` are legal.

### Mixing in flag title and value

Once no ambiguities, any combinations of short flags are ok, even mixing the flag title and raw value string in together:

Therefore `-dr3t` would be interpted to `--debug --retry 3 --timeout`。

> cmdr can backtrace and regress to the up level to solve the matches in parsing time.
