title: With Store
---

## tiny2 Example

By integrated with [hedzr/store](https://github.com/hedzr/store)[^1],
your app can manage its configuration dataset seamlessly and fluently.

> In [tiny1](./g01-first-cli-app) example app, A DummyStore will be created by cmdr internally, which receives any accessing requests to app configuration dataset, and discard them.

As above, we adds the integration to `Store` (hedzr/store), which provides a powerful in-memory hierarchical configuration store.

The multilevel subcommands `jump` > `to` was been also added.

:::tip

[`hedzr/cmdr-loaders`](https://github.com/hedzr/cmdr-loaders/lite) provides a `cmdr.Create()`-like API (`lite.Create()`) with further support to TOML and JSON file formats. It will load those configuration files from standard locations compliant with GNU File strandard and Unix File specification, ....

[`hedzr/cmdr-loaders`](https://github.com/hedzr/cmdr-loaders) is similar with it but has more codecs, such as for YAML, for HCL, and so on. This helper module would import more third-party packages into your project.

On the above, `lite.PrepareApp()` or `loaders.PrepareApp()` provides more wrapper codes.

All purposes of these helpers are:

1. integrated with `store.Store`,
2. integrated with default loaders so the OS env and disk files can be loaded automatically,
3. flatten the basis of an app such as app name, author and others.

:::

In total, `lite.Create()` is first of our recommended list, else are `cmdr.Create()` or `loaders.Create()`.

When a step by step initializing style is what you desire, please use `cmdr.New()`.

### Howto integrate `Store` and `loaders` manually

This is a sample code to show how to integrate `Store` and `loaders` manually, which is similar with `lite.Create()` or `loaders.Create()`.

```go
import "github.com/hedzr/cmdr-loaders/lite"

	app = cmdr.New(
 		// [!code highlight:2]
 		// use an option store explicitly, or a dummy store by default
 		cmdr.WithStore(store.New()),

		// [!code highlight:8]
		// import "github.com/hedzr/cmdr-loaders/local" to get in advanced external loading features
		cmdr.WithExternalLoaders(
			lite.NewConfigFileLoader(
				lite.WithAlternateWriteBack(false), // disable write-back the modified state into alternative config file
				lite.WithAlternateDotPrefix(false), // use '<app-name>.toml' instead of '.<app-name>.toml'
			),
			lite.NewEnvVarLoader(),
		),
	).
		Info("tiny-app", "0.3.1").
		Author("The Example Authors") // .Description(``).Header(``).Footer(``)
```

### Associate your logics with `OnAction` handler

The `OnAction` handler is a callback function that will be executed when the command is invoked. It is a good place to put your business logic.

The normally usage is to attach it to the end of a command building sequence, like this:

```go
app.Cmd("jump", "j", "jumps").
    Description("jump to a subcommand").
    // OnAction(func(cmd cli.Command) error {
    //     // Your business logic here
    //     return nil
    // }).
    With(func(b cli.CommandBuilder) {
        b.Cmd("to", "t", "target").
            Description("jump to a target subcommand").
            OnAction(func(cmd cli.Command) error {
                // Your business logic here
                return nil
            })
    })
```

We do not recommend to use `OnAction` on the `jump` command, because it is a multi-level subcommand. The end users won't realize that `jump` can be executed directly, as it is not the final command they are interested in.

Instead, it is better to use `OnAction` on the `to` command, which is the final command that will be executed.

### `cmd.Store()` vs `cmd.Set()`

### `Build()` and `With(cb)

As a Builder Pattern, `Build()` will end a building sequence in `app/b.Cmd("long","short",...)...Build()`.

But you can always end the building sequence by `With(cb)` call, the form is `app/b.Cmd("long","short",...)...With(cb)`.

In `With(cb)` code block of `jump`, `to` subcommand was been created and attached to.

Similar with it, inside `With(cb)` block of `to`, `full` option was been attached to.

So a end-user can type `tiny2 jump to --full` in shell to enable it.

In `OnAction(cb)` code block, `--full` enables dumping the internal `Store` data structure to console. Just like this following,

```bash
$ go run ./examples/tiny2 jump to --full                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  20:44:31 âœ“ TTY:s014

$

### Operate to `Store`

In this above tree structure,
`app.cmd` subtree includes the mapping to the cmdline options
and its final value of `tiny2` app.

Also, you can read/write the configuration key and value by
`app.Store()/app.Set()`.

As a shortcut, you can use `cmd.Store()` and `cmd.Set()` in
the `OnAction` handler func.

`cmd.Store()` will return a reference to its associating subtree
in the whole Store. So `cmd.Store().MustBool("full")` would
access the final value of `full` option.

`cmd.Set()` returns the whole Store, just like app.Set().
Use it you can pass key path as `cmd.Set().MustBool("app.cmd.jump.to.full")`
to get the value of `full` option.

`app.Set()` is like above, a uncut complete store will be given to you.

`app.Store()` returns the subtree to `app.cmd`, so you can
inspect the values of cmdline options in a better way.
For example, `app.Store().MustBool("jump.to.full")` is
whether a end-user input `--full` at least once at command
line or not.

:::tip

Accessing an integer value by `cmd.MustInt("option-long-name")`, or
a time duration value by `cmd.MustDuration("option-long-name"),
and so on.

### Load external sources

you may load configuration dataset from external sources, such
as a .toml file, a .yaml file, or a remote config center like
consul or etcd.

We will discuss it at next section.

### App ret-code

The subcommand `to` shows you how to terminate the app and
exit to OS with a ret code.
To mark a ret code, invoking `app.SetSuggestRetCode(retCode)`.
It will be retrieved at `main()` function later.
`main()` will use the code to exit to OS, by invoking `os.Exit(app.SuggestRetCode())`.

> Why so complex?
>
> A incorrect way is `exiting at anywhere`.
>
> For a service app or anyelse, you should end a program normally with graceful cleanup,
> which means, the executing step will end at end of `main()`. Thus the running go routines,
> opened resources, connections will be shut down gracefully.
>
> As a best practise, marking ret code with `app.SetSuggestRetCode(retCode)`,
> and returning to `main()` by `return err` deeply,
> so any cleanup codes has chances to be called,
> now you can end the program with `os.Exit(app.SuggestRetCode())` finally,
> which will notify the ret code to OS.
