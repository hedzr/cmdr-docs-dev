## Redirecting root command to a subcmd

`.SetRedirectTo(subcmd)` provides a new target for the Root Command.

`Redirecting root command to a subcmd`, can be used at this scene, makes an input commandline `app` worked as `app a b c`, when the `.SetRedirectTo("a.b.c")` setup.

The well-known case is `pnpm`, a nodejs package manager, which can forward any unmatched commands like `pnpm dev` to `pnpm run ...`, that would be `pnpm run dev`.

### Definitions

The key interface is `*CmdS.SetRedirectTo(dottedCmdPath)`. So whatever we need to do is,

```go title="redirect-to-subcmd/main.go"
func main() {
	app := cmdr.Create(appName, version, author, desc).With(func(app cli.App) {
		// [!code highlight:7]
		// redirect root commands into "wrong" subcmd for testing.
		//
		// For a dad command such as "server" command, it
		// would translate `app start|stop` -> `app server start|stop`.
		app.WithRootCommand(func(root *cli.RootCommand) {
			root.SetRedirectTo("wrong")
		})
	}).WithAdders(cmd.Commands...).Build()

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	if err := app.Run(ctx); err != nil {
		logz.ErrorContext(ctx, "Application Error:", "err", err) // stacktrace if in debug mode/build
		os.Exit(app.SuggestRetCode())
	} else if rc := app.SuggestRetCode(); rc != 0 {
		os.Exit(rc)
	}
}
```

The full codes are in [examples/redirect-to-subcmd](https://github.com/hedzr/cmdr/blob/master/examples/redirect-to-subcmd/).

In this example, `WithAdders(...)` will attach two subcmds into app: `jump to` and `wrong`.

And `With(func(app cli.App){...})` closure block would give you a challenge to operate `app` object in a streaming call.

It is the right position to calling to `SetRedirectTo()`.

As it ran, end-user's `app` will have the same effect with typing `app wrong` in command line.

### Multiple Subcmds

To rediect into a multi-level subcmd as target, you can using `dottedPath`. The `dottedPath` allows a single string to represent the multi-level subcmds. So `SetRedirectTo("jump.to")` could point to the target `jump`/`to` subcmd.

### Run

The result of example app is,

```bash
$ go run ./examples/redirect-to-subcmd
the duration is: 0s
22:57:12.597014+08:00| [ERR] Application Error:                   err="[io: read/write on closed pipe | something's wrong | permission denied]" ./examples/redirect-to-subcmd/main.go:38 main.main
$
```

The returning `Application Error` is the response of the subcmd `wrong`.

Note that the default action of root command is not work any more. So you must request the root help screen by typing `app -h` or `app --help` explicitly.
