## For Linux Cinnamon GUI

Here is the steps:

1. Install `dconf-editor` if not exists

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install dconf-editor
   ```

   **NOTE** that the package name has been changed to `dconf-editor` in newest cinnamon environment.

2. Run `dconf-editor`

3. For Cinnamon:

   1. Navigate into `/org/cinnamon/desktop/interface/text-scaling-factor` by clicking on list item
   2. Uncheck `Use default value` on the config window, and type the number what you want into `Custom value` box, such as 1.25, or others value between 0.5 and 3.
   3. After modified, it looks like:

方法如下：

打开 dconf-editor，定位到：`/org/cinnamon/desktop/interface/text-scaling-factor`，将其修改为 1.25，立即就能看到效果，但谨慎地设置 1..2 之间的值，不要设置其他值以免无法恢复可能的错乱显示状态。

## For Gnome

Same as cinnamon, you can enable this feature in gnome environment:

1. Install `dconf-editor` if not exists

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install dconf-editor
   ```

   **NOTE** that the package name has been changed to `dconf-editor` in newest cinnamon environment.

2. Run `dconf-editor`

3. For Gnome:

   1. Navigate into `/org/gnome/desktop/interface/text-scaling-factor` by clicking on list item
   2. Uncheck `Use default value` on the config window, and type the number what you want into `Custom value` box, such as 1.25, or others value between 0.5 and 3.
