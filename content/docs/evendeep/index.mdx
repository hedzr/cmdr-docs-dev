## Intro to `evendeep`

This is a standard deepcopy library. It provides per-field copying deeply, and compares deeply abilities.

This library is designed for making everything customizable.

## Features

- loosely and reasonable data-types conversions, acrossing primitives, composites and functions, with customizable
  converters/transformers
- unexported values (optional), ...
- circular references immunization
- fully customizable

  - user-defined value/type converters/transformers
  - user-defined field to field name converting rule via struct Tag

- easily apply different strategies

  - basic strategies are: copy-n-merge, clone,
  - strategies per struct field:
    `slicecopy`, `slicemerge`, `mapcopy`, `mapmerge`,
    `omitempty` (keep if source is zero or nil), `omitnil`, `omitzero`,
    `keepneq` (keep if not equal), `cleareq` (clear if equal), ...

- copy fields by name or ordinal

  - field to field
  - field to method, method to field
  - value to function (as input), function result to value
  - slice[0] to struct, struct to slice[0]
  - struct to map, map to struct
  - User-defined extractor/getter on various source
  - User-defined setter for struct or map target (if mapkey is string)
  - ...

- The deep series

  - deepcopy: [`DeepCopy()`](https://github.com/hedzr/evendeep/blob/master/deepcopy.go#L48),
    or [`New()`](https://github.com/hedzr/evendeep/blob/master/deepcopy.go#L32)
  - deepclone:[`MakeClone()`](https://github.com/hedzr/evendeep/blob/master/deepcopy.go#L63)
  - deepequal: [`DeepEqual()`](https://github.com/hedzr/evendeep/blob/master/deepequal.go#L12)
  - deepdiff: [`DeepDiff()`](https://github.com/hedzr/evendeep/blob/master/deepdiff.go#L13)

- Compatibilities

  - Run for Go Modules and Generics enable, and log/slog present (go1.21+ since v1)
    - since v1, `debug/buildinfo` requires go1.18+, `log/slog` wants go1.21+.
    - for the v0.x versions, go1.11+ is okay.

## History

- More in [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hedzr/evendeep/blob/master/CHANGELOG)

## Roadmap

These features had been planning but still on ice.

- [x] Name converting and mapping for `cms.ByOrdinal` (`*`) mode: a universal `name converter` can be applied in copying
      field to field.
- [ ] _Use SourceExtractor and TargetSetter together (might be impossible)_
- [ ] More builtin converters (_might not be a requisite_)
- [x] Handle circular pointer (DONE)

Issue me if you wanna put it or them on the table.
