## Event Handlers associated with a flag

The standard events and its handlers are:

- `.OnParseValue(...OnParseValueHandler)`
- `.OnMatched(...OnMatchedHandler)`
- `.OnChanging(...OnChangingHandler)`
- `.OnChanged(...OnChangedHandler)`
- `.OnSet(...OnSetHandler)`

All of these handlers are specific for each phrases in cmdr runner working: a subcommand will be parsed (`OnParseValue`), parsed ok (`OnMatched`), a flag parsed (`OnMatched`) and the raw string are been parsed as its value (`OnChanging`), and the new value accepted (`OnChanged`), or a store entry value was been changed programmatically (`OnSet`).

The differences of `OnSet` and `OnChanged` is, the first one will be called while `cmd.Store().Set("some.key", newval)` ran, it means a programmatic modification. And the last one will be called while `cmdr` is parsing the command-line arguments.

cmdr-loaders works with `cmdr` main library, and assumes its loading action is `OnLoading(cb)` wrapped. So in the time the `OnSet` won't be triggered.

After loaded, any modifications are recorded, that would be a changeset. The modifications will be written back to a `Alternative` config file at terminating app. The `Write-back` feature can be descibed at [Here](../g11-with-loaders#write-back).
