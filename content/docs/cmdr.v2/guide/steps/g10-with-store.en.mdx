title: With Store
---

## tiny2 Example

By integrated with [hedzr/store](https://github.com/hedzr/store)[^1],
your app can manage its configuration dataset seamlessly and fluently.

> In [tiny1](./g01-first-cli-app) example app, A DummyStore will be created by cmdr internally, which receives any accessing requests to app configuration dataset, and discard them.

```go title="./examples/tiny2/main.go"
package main

import (
	"context"
	"os"

	"github.com/hedzr/cmdr-tests/examples/common"
	"github.com/hedzr/cmdr/v2/cli"
	"github.com/hedzr/cmdr/v2/examples/cmd" // import jumpCmd
	logz "github.com/hedzr/logg/slog"
)

const (
	appName = "tiny2-app"
	desc    = ``
)

func main() {
	// [!code highlight:3]
	app := chain(common.PrepareApp(
		appName, desc,
	)(cmd.Commands...)) // import jumpCmd

	ctx := context.Background() // with cancel can be passed thru in your actions
	if err := app.Run(ctx); err != nil {
		logz.ErrorContext(ctx, "Application Error:", "err", err) // stacktrace if in debug mode/build
		os.Exit(app.SuggestRetCode())
	} else if rc := app.SuggestRetCode(); rc != 0 {
		os.Exit(rc)
	}
}

func chain(app cli.App) cli.App {
	return app
}
```

As above, we adds the integration to `Store` (hedzr/store), which provides a powerful in-memory hierarchical configuration store.

The multilevel subcommands `jump` > `to` was been also added.

### `cmd.Store()` vs `cmd.Set()`

### `Build()` and `With(cb)

As a Builder Pattern, `Build()` will end a building sequence in `app/b.Cmd("long","short",...)...Build()`.

But you can end the building sequence by `With(cb)` call, the form is `app/b.Cmd("long","short",...)...With(cb)`.

In `With(cb)` code block of `jump`, `to` subcommand was been created and attached to.

Similar with it, inside `With(cb)` block of `to`, `full` option was been attached to.

So a end-user can type `tiny2 jump to --full` in shell to enable it.

In `OnAction(cb)` code block, `--full` enables dumping the internal `Store` data structure to console. Just like this following,

```bash
$ go run ./examples/tiny2 jump to --full                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  20:44:31 âœ“ TTY:s014

`jump to` has been invoked, and will return with code '1'.
exit status 1

$
```

### Operate to `Store`

In this above tree structure,
`app.cmd` subtree includes the mapping to the cmdline options
and its final value of `tiny2` app.

Also, you can read/write the configuration key and value by
`app.Store()/app.Set()`.

As a shortcut, you can use `cmd.Store()` and `cmd.Set()` in
the `OnAction` handler func.

`cmd.Store()` will return a reference to its associating subtree
in the whole Store. So `cmd.Store().MustBool("full")` would
access the final value of `full` option.

`cmd.Set()` returns the whole Store, just like app.Set().
Use it you can pass key path as `cmd.Set().MustBool("app.cmd.jump.to.full")`
to get the value of `full` option.

`app.Set()` is like above, a uncut complete store will be given to you.

`app.Store()` returns the subtree to `app.cmd`, so you can
inspect the values of cmdline options in a better way.
For example, `app.Store().MustBool("jump.to.full")` is
whether a end-user input `--full` at least once at command
line or not.

:::tip

Accessing an integer value by `cmd.MustInt("option-long-name")`, or
a time duration value by `cmd.MustDuration("option-long-name"),
and so on.

### Load external sources

you may load configuration dataset from external sources, such
as a .toml file, a .yaml file, or a remote config center like
consul or etcd.

We will discuss it at next section.

### App ret-code

The subcommand `to` shows you how to terminate the app and
exit to OS with a ret code.
To mark a ret code, invoking `app.SetSuggestRetCode(retCode)`.
It will be retrieved at `main()` function later.
`main()` will use the code to exit to OS, by invoking `os.Exit(app.SuggestRetCode())`.

> Why so complex?

> A incorrect way is `exiting at anywhere`.

> For a service app or anyelse, you should end a program normally with graceful cleanup,
> which means, the executing step will end at end of `main()`. Thus the running go routines,
> opened resources, connections will be shut down gracefully.
>
> As a best practise, marking ret code with `app.SetSuggestRetCode(retCode)`,
> and returning to `main()` by `return err` deeply,
> so any cleanup codes has chances to be called,
> now you can end the program with `os.Exit(app.SuggestRetCode())` finally,
> which will notify the ret code to OS.
