## Creating nested subcommands

We mentioned a subcommand should be created inside its parent's `.With(cb)` code block. You may create a lots of them with this way. The nested subcommands would be done.

The following sample shows the concrete steps,

```go title="./examples/lots-subcmds/main.go"
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/hedzr/cmdr-loaders/local"
	"github.com/hedzr/cmdr-tests/examples/common"
	"github.com/hedzr/cmdr-tests/examples/common/cmd"
	"github.com/hedzr/cmdr/v2"
	"github.com/hedzr/cmdr/v2/cli"
	logz "github.com/hedzr/logg/slog"
	"github.com/hedzr/store"
)

const (
	appName = "lots-subcmds"
)

func main() {
	app := chain(common.PrepareApp(
		appName,

		// use an option store explicitly, or a dummy store by default
		cmdr.WithStore(store.New()),

		// import "github.com/hedzr/cmdr-loaders/local" to get in advanced external loading features
		cmdr.WithExternalLoaders(
			local.NewConfigFileLoader(
				local.WithAlternateWriteBack(false), // disable write-back the modified state into alternative config file
				local.WithAlternateDotPrefix(false), // use '<app-name>.toml' instead of '.<app-name>.toml'
			),
			local.NewEnvVarLoader(),
		),
	)(cmd.Commands...))

	ctx := context.Background() // with cancel can be passed thru in your actions
	if err := app.Run(ctx); err != nil {
		logz.ErrorContext(ctx, "Application Error:", "err", err) // stacktrace if in debug mode/build
		os.Exit(app.SuggestRetCode())
	} else if rc := app.SuggestRetCode(); rc != 0 {
		os.Exit(rc)
	}
}

// [!code highlight:18]
func chain(app cli.App) cli.App {
	app.Cmd("subcmd").
		Description("subcommands here").
		With(func(b cli.CommandBuilder) {
			for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
				b.Cmd(fmt.Sprintf("sub-%d", i)).
					Description(fmt.Sprintf("subcommand-%d here", i)).
					With(func(b cli.CommandBuilder) {
						for j := 0; j < 3; j++ {
							b.Cmd(fmt.Sprintf("sub-%d-sub-%d", i, j)).
								Description(fmt.Sprintf("sub-%d-subcommand=%d here", i, j)).
								With(func(b cli.CommandBuilder) {})
						}
					})
			}
		})
	return app
}
```

Now run it with command line option `~~tree`, which is a builtin option with `cmdr.v2`, to dump all commands hierarchy as following:

```bash
$ FORCE_DEFAULT_ACTION=1 go run ./examples/lots-subcmds/ ~~tree
...
```

So the result would be like,

![image-20250217213824849](/cmdr/v2/guide/_assets/g10-lots-of-subcommands/image-20250217213824849.png)

### Remarks

The environment variable with value `FORCE_DEFAULT_ACTION=1` makes `cmdr.v2` ignore your custom `OnAction` to invoke a builtin responsed callback function, which will display a debug list for the hit command and the hit flags of its.

This would be useful for debugging.

As like `jump` command, which marked by `.Deprecated("v1.2.3")`, it will be shown with through-line and dim effect.

A hidden command or flag (with `.Hidden(true)`) will be shown in help screen with dim effect, while you gave an extra option `--verbose` in command line to force it visible. In normal mode, the hidden them are invisble.

A vendor-hidden command or flag (with `.Hidden(true, true)`) can be shown in help screen only if you gave triple verbose option by `--verbose --verbose --verbose` or `-vvv`.

cmdr.v2 also have more builtin commands and options, such as `--version`, `--debug`, `--quite`, and so on. You can query its visible in help screen by `-vvv`.

Therefore, as like `~~tree` and `~~debug`, which called as `TILDE-option`, some special meanings are assumed.

The `~~tree` will show the commands hierarchical structure, with or without its flags.

The `~~debug` will print the builtin `Store` state, which named as `Option Store` in `cmdr.v1`, a settings manager or a hierarchical key-value store.

:::tip

NOTE that `~~debug` is different with `--debug`/`-D`, which assumed enabling or disabling debug mode (application working mode).
